# Solar-Power-Data-Scraper
This Python script scrapes solar power generation data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) website. It allows users to specify a start and end date range for data retrieval. The scraped data includes the date and power output in megawatts (MW) and is saved into a CSV file for further analysis.
Description
The script utilizes the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to fetch and parse the HTML content of the NREL webpage containing solar power data. It then extracts the relevant data from the HTML table and performs data cleaning and validation to ensure the integrity of the dataset.

Features
User Interaction: Users can input start and end dates to specify the data range.
Error Handling: The script handles potential errors gracefully, such as invalid date formats or missing data.
Modularization: The code is organized into functions for better readability and maintainability.
Data Export: The scraped data is saved into a CSV file named 'solar_power_data.csv' for easy access and further analysis.
Documentation: Comments within the code explain the purpose of each function and how to use the script.
