# Solar-Power-Data-Scraper
This Python script scrapes solar power generation data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) website. It allows users to specify a start and end date range for data retrieval. The scraped data includes the date and power output in megawatts (MW) and is saved into a CSV file for further analysis.
